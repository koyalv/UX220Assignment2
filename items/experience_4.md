### VP PSB - Full Time Job
- This is my first full time role as Vice President of Programming and Services for the Students' Union. 
- This is currently my role and I will finish the role in April with graduation. 
- This role allows me to advocate for students and make connections on campus, I also get to plan really cool events for the campus as well. 
- This role is definetely challenging and because it is event based the hours are long and tiring which becomes hard with school. 
- The experience is an A PLUS!
