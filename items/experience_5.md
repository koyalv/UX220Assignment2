### Planning O-Week 2023
- In my role as VP Programming and Services, my team and I planned Orienation Week for all incoming Laurier students. 
- This is a project I completed from May-August of this year and Orientation Week was held in September. 
- This was a full circle moment for me as I was a volunteer for many Orientation Weeks before this role, the events were amazing and the students had a ton of fun. 
- It is an exhausting process and in my role I had to manage the volunteers and a lot of dynamics and emotions which takes a toll. 
- This experience was an A.
