### Travel to Tanzania
- I traveled to East Africa and more specifically Tanzania with my family. 
- We went on this trip from December 2006-January 2007
- This trip is the reason for so many of my memories, I was able to see where my parents grew up, meet some family and experience a completely different culture. 
- Being so young we had to be careful about what we ate and we had to take a lot of vaccines and medicine before we left. 
- I would give this experience an A.
