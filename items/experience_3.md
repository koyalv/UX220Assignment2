### First Class at Laurier 
- My first class at Laurier was DMJN 101: Introduction to News Writing and Reporting. 
- I did this course on Tuesday mornings at 8:30am in my first year. 
- This was a slower paced course to help us get use to the university life, and it was such a great introduction to my program because I learnt all of the different aspects of journalism.  
- My favourite memory was when Bruce brought in an alumni panel of recent graduates from our program to inspire us and we could ask them questions. 
- I did not enjoy the early start on some days and it was a challenging course as well. 
- This experience is a B.
