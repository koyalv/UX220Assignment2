### First Job at No Frills 
- My first job was at my local No Frills in Markham as a cashier. 
- I did this job through highschool starting in 2015 and finishing in 2018. 
- I loved working as a cashier and talking to customers, it was also really good for me to save up some of my money while working there. 
- My favourtie memory is closing on Sunday nights because this is the shift that all my friends would work together so we would have so much fun. 
- Sometimes the customers were rude and it was really long hours, I also had to give up a lot of my nights and weekends to take shifts. 
- This experience is a B.
